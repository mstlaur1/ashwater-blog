*A short story generated by a 15M parameter model running on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W.*

On top of a hill, there was a small bird. The bird was very excited. She wanted to fly to the other side of the hill.
As she flew up, she saw a big tree. She thought, "I will sit on the tree and rest. It's so cool up here." But when she got to the tree, she saw that it was very dry.
The bird flew down from the tree. She saw a big cat on the ground. The cat was also on the hill. The bird was scared. She did not want to hit the cat. The cat saw the bird and smiled.
"Hello, bird," said the cat. "Why are you here? It's so cool up here."
The bird replied, "Hi, cat! I was just resting. The sun is not too hot."
The cat thought for a moment. Then, the cat said, "I will play with you, but you must not hit me. I don't like it when you lie down."
The bird thought about it and said, "Okay, let's play. But we must not lie down on the dry hill."
So, the bird and the cat played on
