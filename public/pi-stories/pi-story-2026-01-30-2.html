<p>By the river, a friendlybird lived. One day, a frog jumped out of the water and landed near the ducks. The frog looked very small and sad.
The fish saw the frog and thought it was funny. &#8220;Why are you so happy?&#8221; asked one fish.</p>
<p>The frog said, &#8220;I am a frog! I can&#8217;t fly like a bird or swim fast.&#8221;
The friendly fish wanted to help the frog. So, they went on an adventure together.</p>
<p>They met other animals who didn&#8217;t like the frog because he couldn&#8217;t fly. But then, one day, something unexpected happened. The fish started to grow and grow!</p>
<p>It became a big, strong bird with many wings.
The frog was so surprised but also happy for his new friend. Now, he could jump high in the sky like a bird. And they both laughed and played together every day.</p>
