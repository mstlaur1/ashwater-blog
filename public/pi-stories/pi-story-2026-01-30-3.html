<h1>Tom's Yard</h1>

<p>One sunny morning, a curiouscat named Tom went for a walk. He saw a little girl named Lily playing in her yard. The yard had many pretty flowers and green trees.
Tom walked up to Lily and said, &#8220;Hi!</p>
<p>I am Tom the cat. What is your name?&#8221; Lily smiled and said, &#8220;Hi Tom! My name is Lily.&#8221; They both looked at each other and smiled.
Lily wanted to play with Tom.</p>
<p>She said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s scatter the flowers around the yard!&#8221; So they scattered all around, making a big mess. They laughed and played together until it was time for dinner.</p>
