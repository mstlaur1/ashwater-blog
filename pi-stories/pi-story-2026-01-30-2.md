By the river, a friendlybird lived. One day, a frog jumped out of the water and landed near the ducks. The frog looked very small and sad.
The fish saw the frog and thought it was funny. "Why are you so happy?" asked one fish.

The frog said, "I am a frog! I can't fly like a bird or swim fast."
The friendly fish wanted to help the frog. So, they went on an adventure together.

They met other animals who didn't like the frog because he couldn't fly. But then, one day, something unexpected happened. The fish started to grow and grow!

It became a big, strong bird with many wings.
The frog was so surprised but also happy for his new friend. Now, he could jump high in the sky like a bird. And they both laughed and played together every day.
