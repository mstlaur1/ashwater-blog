One sunny morning, a curiouscat named Tom went for a walk. He saw a little girl named Lily playing in her yard. The yard had many pretty flowers and green trees.
Tom walked up to Lily and said, "Hi!

I am Tom the cat. What is your name?" Lily smiled and said, "Hi Tom! My name is Lily." They both looked at each other and smiled.
Lily wanted to play with Tom.

She said, "Let's scatter the flowers around the yard!" So they scattered all around, making a big mess. They laughed and played together until it was time for dinner.
