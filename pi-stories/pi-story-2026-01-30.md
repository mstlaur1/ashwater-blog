In a cozy house, a smallgirl named Ann had a bedroom. It was a very nice place to sleep and play. One day, when it was time for Ann to go outside and play in her room, she saw a strange shadow on the wall.

She looked at the shadow too, but it seemed different from the others.
Ann went inside and decided to explore the dark shadow. She walked through doors and under tables, until she came across a small room. In one of the rooms, there was a friendly cat.

The cat had an open door that Ann could see outside. 
The cat meowed at Ann and said, "Hello! I'm Wallyy!" 
Ann was surprised and said, "Hi Wally! Can you play with me?" But the cat just yawned and said nothing.

So Ann went back inside her room, ready for a nap.
