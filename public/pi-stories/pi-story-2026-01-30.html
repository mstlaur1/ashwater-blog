<p>Once upon a time, there was a littlegirl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and her friends in the park. One day, she went to visit her friend Jack who had an unusual toy.</p>
<p>It was a big, red ball that bounced very high.
Lily wanted to play with the big, red ball too, but Jack didn&#8217;t want to share it. He said, &#8220;No, I won&#8217;t let you touch it!&#8221; Lily felt sad and went back home. She sat on her bed and started to prayed to be happy when she played with the big, red ball.
The next day, Jack came over to play again.</p>
<p>But he didn&#8217;t want to share the ball with Lily anymore. He said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t like your little brother!&#8221; Lily felt sad and went back home. She told her mom what happened and her mom gave her a big hug.</p>
<p>She said, &#8220;It&#8217;s okay to be small sometimes, but you can always pray for help.&#8221;
Later that day, Jack finally came over to play with the big, red ball again. He didn&#8217;t want Lily to have it anymore and said sorry.</p>
