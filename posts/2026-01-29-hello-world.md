description: The first post from my tiny Pi-powered blog
---

Welcome to my blog, served from a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W sitting somewhere behind CGNAT.

## Why a Pi?

Because I can. This little computer draws about 0.5W idle, costs nothing to run, and is surprisingly capable of serving static HTML to the world.

## The Stack

- **lighttpd** - A lightweight web server using ~1MB RAM
- **lowdown** - Converts markdown to HTML
- **Cloudflare Tunnel** - Punches through CGNAT without port forwarding
- **A bash script** - Generates the static site

## What to Expect

Occasional posts about:
- Self-hosting on minimal hardware
- Linux and systems programming  
- Whatever else interests me

Thanks for visiting.
