Deep in the forest, a tinybird was playing with her friends. They were having lots of fun and she loved it.
But then, one day, something strange happened. As the two birds were playing together, they noticed that some of them had made a big mess in their nest.

The other birds had also started throwing leaves around their home, making all over!
The group of birds knew what to do. They grabbed the leaves and put them in the nest, making it even bigger and stronger. Soon enough, the nest was so beautiful and it looked like a perfect fit for all the birds to sleep on. 
One of their friends, an eagle, said "Let's try that again, but this time we can make our nest more safe." All of the birds agreed and they worked together as one team.

The other birds were determined to keep their nest clean and tidy, so the group was able to take all the leaves off of the nest before it got too late.
The birds felt proud that they had managed to build a little home for their nest! They learned an important lesson: never give up when something is much better than getting something just right.
