<h1>About</h1>

<p>I'm Mikhail St-Laurent. Father first, airline pilot second, tinkerer third.</p>

<p>I live in the Laurentians, north of Montreal. When I'm not flying or chasing kids, I'm usually taking something apart or putting something together—physically or digitally.</p>

<h2>Why This Site Exists</h2>

<p>A few years ago I got frustrated paying monthly fees for software I could host myself. It started with budgeting (YNAB → Actual Budget on a Pi), and quickly spiraled into an obsession with self-hosting everything I could.</p>

<p>Somewhere along the way, I realized I wanted to write about it. Not for an audience, really—more as a journal. A place to document projects, share what I learn, and occasionally ramble about planes or parenting.</p>

<h2>Why a Raspberry Pi?</h2>

<p>In an era of unlimited cloud compute and JavaScript frameworks that ship megabytes of code to display text, there's something refreshing about constraints. The Pi Zero 2 W has 512MB of RAM and costs $15. It forces you to think carefully about what you actually need.</p>

<p>It reminds me of the old days of game development, when programmers squeezed magic out of hardware limitations. The constraint isn't a burden—it's the creative challenge.</p>

<p>Plus, it's satisfying to know this entire site runs on less power than an LED bulb.</p>

<h2>What I Write About</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Self-hosting</strong> — Running services on minimal hardware, taking back control from SaaS</li>
<li><strong>Aviation</strong> — Occasional notes from the flight deck</li>
<li><strong>Tinkering</strong> — Hardware projects, home automation, general hacking</li>
<li><strong>Life</strong> — Fatherhood, the Laurentians, whatever else seems worth writing down</li>
</ul>

<h2>Colophon</h2>

<p>This site is served from a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W sitting on a shelf in my house. No frameworks, no build tools beyond a bash script, no tracking. Just HTML, CSS, and a Cloudflare tunnel.</p>

<p>The daily <a href="/pi-stories/">Pi Stories</a> are generated by a 15-million parameter AI model running directly on the Pi at 3am.</p>

<p>See the <a href="/colophon.html">colophon</a> for live system stats and technical details.</p>
