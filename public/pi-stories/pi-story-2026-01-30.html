<p><em>A short story generated by a 15M parameter model running on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W.</em></p>
<p>On top of a hill, there was abig tree. Under the tree lived a small boy named Tom and his mom. Tom had a toy car that he loved to play with every day.</p>
<p>One day, Tom&#8217;s mom said it was time for him to go outside and play.
Tom was playing on the hill when he saw something interesting. It was a big, shiny rock. The rock was very pretty and looked like an arrow.</p>
<p>Tom picked up the rock and showed it to his mom. She told him that the rock could do lots of magic.
The next day, Tom went outside with his mom and found a special rock on the ground. This rock was different because it had a note tied around its neck.</p>
<p>The note said, &#8220;I am a magic rock.&#8221; Tom took the special rock home to show his mom and dad. They were very surprised and happy.
From that day on, Tom and his family would go for walks under the big tree with the shiny rock. Every time they went, the special rock made them smile and feel special.</p>
<p>And they all lived happily ever after.</p>
